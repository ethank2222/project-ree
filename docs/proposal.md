## Project Summary



## Project Goals

**Minimum Goal**
Our minimum goal is to create a simulation that models cars only arriving at a 4-way traffic light controlled intersection over the course of a week. Based on this simulation, our AI algorithm will continually learn and optimize the light schedule for each direction, including left turn and straight green lights.

**Realistic Goal**
Our realistic goal is to create a simulation that models cars and pedestrians arriving at a 4-way traffic light controlled intersection over the course of a week. Based on this simulation, our AI algorithm will continually learn and optimize the light and crossing schedules for each direction, including left turn and straight green lights.

**Moonshot Goal**
Our moonshot goal is to create a simulation that models cars and pedestrians arriving at an n-way traffic light controlled intersection over the course of a week. This intersection could have 1-way streets, or even be a 6-way intersection. Based on any situation, our AI algorithm would continually learn and optimize the light schedule and crossing schedule for each direction.
