## Project Summary
Our AI signal system is an intelligent traffic signal that minimizes idle time at intersections. It uses contextual information including the total number of cars, lane occupancy, time of day, and pedestrian presence. Unlike traditional traffic signals, it makes informed decisions based on historical data and real-time context to minimize wait times without compromising safety.

## Project Goals

**Minimum Goal**
Our minimum goal is to create a simulation that models cars only arriving at a 4-way traffic light controlled intersection over the course of a week. Based on this simulation, our AI algorithm will continually learn and optimize the light schedule for each direction, including left turn and straight green lights.

**Realistic Goal**
Our realistic goal is to create a simulation that models cars and pedestrians arriving at a 4-way traffic light controlled intersection over the course of a week. Based on this simulation, our AI algorithm will continually learn and optimize the light and crossing schedules for each direction, including left turn and straight green lights.

**Moonshot Goal**
Our moonshot goal is to create a simulation that models cars and pedestrians arriving at an n-way traffic light controlled intersection over the course of a week. This intersection could have 1-way streets, or even be a 6-way intersection. Based on any situation, our AI algorithm would continually learn and optimize the light schedule and crossing schedule for each direction.

## AI/ML Algorithms
Tentatively, we will use Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), a model-free, on-policy reinforcement learning algorithm with a neural network function approximator.
