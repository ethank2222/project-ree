## Project Summary
Our AI signal system is an intelligent traffic signal that minimizes idle time at intersections. It uses contextual information including the total number of cars, lane occupancy, time of day, and pedestrian presence. Unlike traditional traffic signals, it makes informed decisions based on historical data and real-time context to minimize wait times without compromising safety.
